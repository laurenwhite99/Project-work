            <ol class="box-list">
                <li>Preheat your oven to 200Â°C, bring a large saucepan of water to the boil with 1/4 tsp of salt. Chop the potatoes into 2cm chunks (no need to peel). Peel the garlic cloves. Add the potatoes and the garlic clove to the boiling water and simmer until tender, 15-20 mins. Once cooked, drain in a colander and pop back into your pan.</li>
                <li>Next, pop a frying pan on medium-high heat (no oil). Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Once hot, lay the chicken in the pan skin-side down, fry until the skin is golden, 5 mins. Turn, cook for 1 minute on the flesh side to seal the meat. IMPORTANT: Wash your hands after handling chicken and its packaging. Transfer to a large baking tray skin-side up and roast on the top shelf of your oven until cooked, 15-20 mins.</li>
                <li>Trim the root of the bok choy and separate the leaves. Halve the plums, remove the stone and slice the flesh of each plum into 12 thin wedges. Trim and thinly slice the spring onion. When the chicken has had 10 mins in the oven, add the bok choy to the baking tray around the chicken breasts (not covering), drizzle a little oil over the top, season and return to the oven for the remaining cooking time, 5-10 mins.</li>
                <li>Pop your frying pan back on medium-high heat (no need to wash). Add a drizzle of oil if the pan is dry, then add the plums to the pan and fry, turning them every minute until softened, 2-3 mins. Pour in the water and add the sugar (see ingredients for both amounts), chicken stock paste and hoisin sauce. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat slightly and gently simmer until thickened, 3-5 mins. TIP: Add a splash of water if it thickens too much. Once cooked, set aside.</li>
                <li>Once the chicken and bok choy is cooked, remove from your oven, cover the tray with some foil and leave to rest for 5-6 mins. IMPORTANT: The chicken is cooked when it is no longer pink in the middle.</li>
                <li>Once the potatoes are cooked and back in their pan, add the spring onion along with a knob of butter and splash of milk (if you have any). Season with salt and pepper and then mash. Cover with a lid to keep warm. Reheat the plum sauce with a splash of water if you need to. Pile the mash onto the plates, top with the chicken breast and share the bok choy alongside. Spoon the hoisin plum sauce over the chicken and enjoy!</li>
